    <h2>dwm, part 1</h2>
    <p class="date">2019-08-28</p>
    <p class="clear"></p>
    <p>In this short series, we'll set up a quite basic but comfortable
  enough <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/" target="_blank">dwm</a>
  installation.</p>
<h3>What is dwm?</h3>
<p>It's a tiling window manager; other examples of such include then-the-coolest
  <span class="inlineCode">i3</span>, <span class="inlineCode">bspwm</span> and
  the classic <span class="inlineCode">ratpoison</span>.</p>
<p>One of dwm's distinctive features is its adherence to
  <a href="https://suckless.org/philosophy/" target="_blank">suckless
  philosophy</a>. It aims to bring back core UNIX values of creating simple
  applications that excel at the one thing they're doing. Otherwise, it's
  a very lightweight and productive WM, much so that I've switched to it from
  GNOME (quite a transition!).</p>
<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>Let's start by installing dependencies required to build dwm and it's
  terminal emulator, <span class="inlineCode">st</span>. This will be the
  only distro-dependent step in this tutorial. If you're not using Arch
  Linux you'll need to find out how to install
  <span class="inlineCode">Xlib</span> headers (as per dwm's README) and
  dmenu (not necessary but very much recommended). Otherwise:</p> 
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
<span class="nb">cat</span> <span class="s">&lt;&lt; EOF</span> | <span class="nb">grep</span> -v <span class="s">&#39;#&#39;</span> | <span class="nb">tr</span> <span class="s">&#39; &#39; &#39;\n&#39;</span> | <span class="nb">sudo</span> pacman -S --needed -
<span class="s"># st dependencies</span>
<span class="s">libxext libxft xorg-fonts-misc ncurses</span>
<span class="s"># additional dwm dependencies</span>
<span class="s">dmenu freetype2 libx11 libxinerama</span>
<span class="s"># these are not required but will be useful later on</span>
<span class="s">xorg-xsetroot xorg-xfontsel xorg-xfd</span>
<span class="s">EOF</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now, to download the sources. You can approach building dwm and friends
  in many different manners, but to get the hang of things its best to do it
  the old-fashioned way.</p>
<p>Let's start by creating a directory to store our sources. I'll go with
  <span class="inlineCode">~/.suckless</span>. Then, we'll download and extract
  the source code.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
<span class="c1"># create the directory for our sources</span>
<span class="nb">mkdir</span> ~/.suckless <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="nb">cd</span> ~/.suckless <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="c1"># download current (as of writing this article) st and dwm</span>
<span class="nb">curl</span> -O https://dl.suckless.org/st/st-0.8.2.tar.gz <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="nb">curl</span> -O https://dl.suckless.org/dwm/dwm-6.2.tar.gz <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="c1"># extract the tarballs</span>
<span class="nb">tar</span> xf st-0.8.2.tar.gz <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="nb">tar</span> xf dwm-6.2.tar.gz <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="c1"># clean up</span>
<span class="nb">rm</span> *.tar.gz
</pre></div>
<p>Now we just need to compile and install the applications. As you'll notice,
  it's a very quick process thanks to extremely clean codebase.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
<span class="c1"># building st first, since it&#39;s required by dwm</span>
<span class="nb">cd</span> st-0.8.2 <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="nb">sudo</span> make clean install <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="c1"># dwm now</span>
<span class="nb">cd</span> ../dwm-6.2 <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="nb">sudo</span> make clean install
</pre></div>
<p>By default, the applications will be installed in
  <span class="inlineCode">/usr/local/bin</span>. But before we launch dwm
  for the first time, let's touch upon the topic of customizations we'll
  be performing in the near future</p>
<p>If you now visit either st's or dwm's source directory, you may notice
  that a new file, <span class="inlineCode">config.h</span>, has appeared
  in both of them. This is the file we'll be editing in order to change
  the behavior and appearance of st and dwm. Meanwhile,
  <span class="inlineCode">config.def.h</span> contains default configuration,
  which is quite useful, if we mess the configuration header.</p>
<p>Either way, I recommend setting up a local git repo for our suckless
  applications in order to make tracking and reverting changes even easier.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
<span class="nb">cd</span> ~/.suckless <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="nb">git</span> init <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="nb">git</span> add * <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="nb">git</span> commit -m <span class="s1">&#39;vanilla installation&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now every time we change our settings, we'll be able to commit the
  changes along with a helpful description for further reference, as well
  as revert changes we didn't like. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
<span class="c1"># for more information, consult `man git`</span>
<span class="c1"># cancel our latest changes if we&#39;ve commited them</span>
<span class="nb">git</span> revert HEAD
<span class="c1"># cancel our latest changes if we haven&#39;t commited them yet</span>
<span class="nb">git</span> reset --hard
</pre></div>
<h3>Starting dwm</h3>
<p>If you're using a fancy display manager (e.g. <span class="inlineCode">GDM</span>,
  <span class="inlineCode">SDDM</span>) then just select
  <span class="inlineCode">dwm</span> as your session of choice during login.</p>
<p>I myself prefer good ol' <span class="inlineCode">startx</span>
  (package <span class="inlineCode">xorg-xinit</span> on Arch).
  If this is your case as well, just add <span class="inlineCode">exec dwm</span>
  to your <span class="inlineCode">~/.xinitrc</span> file. When you
  call <span class="inlineCode">startx</span> next time, you'll be greeted
  by dwm.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
grep <span class="s1">&#39;\bexec\b&#39;</span> ~/.xinitrc &gt; /dev/null <span class="m">2</span>&gt;<span class="p">&amp;</span><span class="m">1</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="c1"># if we&#39;re already executing something else, replace it with dwm</span>
sed -i <span class="s1">&#39;s/\bexec\s\+[[:alnum:]]\+/exec dwm/&#39;</span> ~/.xinitrc <span class="o">||</span> <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="c1"># otherwise, just add the line to the end of file</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;exec dwm&#39;</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.xinitrc
</pre></div>
<h3>What's next?</h3>
<p>In the next part, we'll start personalizing dwm and st. In the meantime,
  make yourself familiar with dwm's basic concepts and shortcuts.
  You need only two shortcuts (well, technically one of them) to get started:
  <ul>
    <li><span class="inlineCode">Alt-Shift-Enter</span> - open the terminal</li>
    <li><span class="inlineCode">Alt-P</span> - open dmenu's prompt
      (it's a simple application launcher)</li>
  </ul>
